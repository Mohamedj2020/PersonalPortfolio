# Mohamed Jirac - Portfolio Website

A modern, responsive portfolio website showcasing my journey as a Computer Science student and aspiring Software Engineer. Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, featuring smooth animations and a professional design.

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

This portfolio represents my technical skills, academic projects, and professional experience. As a junior at The Ohio State University studying Computer Science, I've designed this site to demonstrate both my development capabilities and my growth in the field of software engineering.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a seamless experience across devices
- **Interactive Components**: Leverages the power of React to create engaging user interactions
- **TypeScript Integration**: Ensures robust type-checking and improved developer experience

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React 19.1.1, TypeScript 4.9.5
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.15
- **Build Tool**: Create React App
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library

## Getting Started

To explore or modify the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Mohamedj2020/PersonalPortfolio.git
cd my-portfolio

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm start
```

Open your browser and navigate to `localhost:3000` to view the site.

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder
- `npm run eject` - Ejects from Create React App (one-way operation)

## Architecture

The project follows a modern component-based architecture:

- **Components**: Located in `src/components/`, these are modular, reusable, and styled using utility classes from Tailwind CSS.
  - Components like `Hero`, `About`, `Projects` encapsulate related logic and UI.
- **State Management**: Utilizes React's built-in state management with hooks to track and handle UI state efficiently.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used for a utility-first approach, ensuring consistency and flexibility.
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Configured with strict settings in `tsconfig.json` to promote robustness and type safety in development.

## Developer Experience

- **TypeScript**: Ensure correct typings and prevent bugs with strict type-checking rules.
  - With settings like `noImplicitAny`, the project avoids unexpected errors by enforcing explicit types.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Extensible and easily configurable according to `tailwind.config.js`.
  - The `content` array ensures that all components using Tailwind styles are covered.
