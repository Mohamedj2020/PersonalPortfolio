# My Portfolio

A personal portfolio website built with React and TypeScript. Still a work in progress, but getting there!

## What's This?

This is where I showcase my projects and skills. Built it from scratch to learn more about React and to have a place to show off my work.

## Tech I'm Using

- React & TypeScript, HTML5
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Create React App (because it just works)
- Deployed on [coming soon]

## Running It Locally

If you want to check it out or mess around with the code:

```bash
# Get the code
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd my-portfolio

# Install stuff
npm install

# Start it up
npm start
```

Then go to `localhost:3000` and you should see it running.

## What's Working

- âœ… Basic React setup
- âœ… Tailwind CSS configured
- âœ… TypeScript compilation
- ðŸš§ Everything else (working on it!)

## What's Coming

- About section with my background
- Portfolio projects showcase
- Contact form that actually works
- Some nice animations
- Mobile-friendly design
- Actual deployment somewhere

## Current Status

Just got the development environment set up and working through some Tailwind CSS configuration issues. Next up is building out the actual portfolio components.

## Contact

Once this is done, you'll be able to reach me through the contact form. For now, find me on:

## Notes

- This is a learning project as much as a portfolio
- Code might be messy in places - still refactoring
- Open to feedback if you have any suggestions
